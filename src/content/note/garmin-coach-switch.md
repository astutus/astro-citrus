title: Garmin Coach – Time to Try the “Adaptive” Plan

After completing several Garmin 5K training plans with Jeff, Greg, and Amy, I’ve decided to give the new **adaptive Garmin Coach** a try.

The older plans were solid in structure — but rigid. Despite being marketed as “adaptive,” they didn't actually respond to recovery status, illness, or fatigue. Plans were hidden week by week, with no flexibility beyond skipping a session.

Now Garmin claims to have upgraded the system:  
> “A truly personalized training plan that adapts as you progress.”

📎 [Official Garmin announcement – August 2024](https://www.garmin.com/en-US/newsroom/press-release/wearables-health/train-smarter-with-personalized-garmin-coach-training-plans-that-can-adapt-to-help-you-reach-your-goals/)

Sounds good on paper. But support didn’t give me any details beyond what’s already in the press release, and I couldn’t find any in-depth user reviews either.

That said, I’m curious — and cautiously optimistic.

I’ve already loaded up the **17-week adaptive 5K plan**, starting from February 5 to May 28. It includes 7 workouts per week, so the volume is serious. My goal is not just to run faster, but to train smarter — and see if Garmin finally delivers on what “adaptive” really means.

Let’s see what happens.
