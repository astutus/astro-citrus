## I Used to Hate Running

Let me be clear: I **absolutely hated running**.

It wasn‚Äôt fun. It didn‚Äôt feel good. It wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúfreeing‚Äù or ‚Äúeuphoric.‚Äù  
I wasn‚Äôt overweight, but I was bulky ‚Äî about 100 kg with some gym muscle ‚Äî and I couldn‚Äôt even run a single kilometer in my twenties.  
Looking back, I‚Äôd call that... a form of advanced physical dysfunction.

And I had no childhood background in running. No "natural base." I was just a gym guy who avoided cardio.

## One Random Website Changed Everything

One day I found a Polish website that explained why running is worth trying ‚Äî physically, mentally, emotionally. Something about it clicked.  
There was a 10-week beginner training plan that looked very doable. Run-walk sessions, gradually increasing.

I gave it a try.

Week by week, I followed the schedule. It worked.  
And 10 weeks later ‚Äî for the first time in my life ‚Äî I ran for **30 minutes straight**.

I was shocked. It felt incredible. I couldn‚Äôt believe something this difficult had such a simple solution.

## Then I Quit (And Had to Start Again)

After that, I kept running for a few more weeks... and then stopped. Life got busy.  
Six months later I tried to run again and ‚Äî surprise ‚Äî I couldn‚Äôt even make it through 1 km.

So I started over. And again, it worked.

This time I discovered the book _‚ÄúBiegiem przez ≈ºycie‚Äù_ by Jerzy Skar≈ºy≈Ñski ‚Äî a legendary Polish marathoner.  
In it, he wrote something that stayed with me:

> ‚ÄúRunning for 30 minutes is like climbing a small hill ‚Äî you can easily fall back down.  
> But running for 1 hour is like reaching a mountaintop. It‚Äôs very hard to fall off.‚Äù

Eventually I reached that mountaintop. I could run for an hour ‚Äî and even after another long break, I could still run without starting from scratch.  
That‚Äôs when I knew: I‚Äôd **truly learned how to run**.

## Then I Taught My 9-Year-Old Daughter

My daughter plays football (soccer), and in 2024 I encouraged her to try the same 10-week plan.

And guess what?

It worked **exactly the same way**.  
She went from struggling to run a few minutes‚Ä¶ to running 30 minutes straight at around **7:20/km** pace.  
And it had a huge impact on her performance:

- In her football team (where she was the **only girl**), she jumped from 6th to **2nd place** in endurance runs ‚Äî against boys.  
- In school, where the runs were **not separated by gender**, she went from 3rd to **1st overall**.

That progress? Purely from this plan.

## The Beginner-Friendly 10-Week Run-Walk Plan

Here‚Äôs the exact plan we used:

| Week | Tue                | Thu                | Sat                | Sun                |
|------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 1    | 5 √ó 2‚Ä≤ run / 4‚Ä≤ walk | same             | same               | same               |
| 2    | 5 √ó 3‚Ä≤ run / 3‚Ä≤ walk | same             | same               | same               |
| 3    | 4 √ó 5‚Ä≤ run / 2.5‚Ä≤ walk | same           | same               | same               |
| 4    | 3 √ó 7‚Ä≤ run / 3‚Ä≤ walk | same             | same               | same               |
| 5    | 3 √ó 8‚Ä≤ run / 2‚Ä≤ walk | same             | same               | same               |
| 6    | 3 √ó 9‚Ä≤ run / 2‚Ä≤ walk | same             | same               | same               |
| 7    | 3 √ó 9‚Ä≤ run / 1‚Ä≤ walk | same             | same               | same               |
| 8    | 2 √ó 13‚Ä≤ run / 2‚Ä≤ walk | same            | same               | same               |
| 9    | 2 √ó 14‚Ä≤ run / 1‚Ä≤ walk | same            | same               | same               |
| 10   | 30‚Ä≤ continuous run   | same             | same               | same               |

That‚Äôs it. Simple. Free. Life-changing.

## Final Thoughts

So yeah ‚Äî I really believe **anyone can learn to run**.  
If I did it, you can too. My daughter did it. Your kid can too.

And did I ever learn to love running?

Well‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a story for another post. üòÖ
