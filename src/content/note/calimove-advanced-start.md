After about 9 months of regular training, I’ve made it to **Level 3 – proudly labeled “Advanced”** in the Calimove system.  
Honestly? The name might be a bit of a stretch, but for the first time I’m seeing real **calisthenics-specific skills** in the program.

We’re finally working with exercises like:

- ✅ Skin the Cat  
- ✅ L-Sit  
- ✅ Handstand  
- ✅ Typewriter Pull-Ups  
- ✅ Archer Push-Ups  
- ✅ Pistol Squats  

The whole program will run for **around 4 months**, and I’m jumping in with solid enthusiasm.

One week ago I hit two personal records:  
- **21 chin-ups** with clean form  
- **17 pull-ups**, improving by 1 rep from my previous best

Let’s see how far I can take this.  
The grind continues.
