On March 16th, I finally did it — I bought **Calimove Mobility 2.0**.

It’s a 32-week program, structured into four progressive phases: *Prep Phase*, *Level 1*, *Level 2*, and *Level 3*.  
The early sessions are short — just 6 to 7 minutes — but toward the end, some workouts stretch to 30 minutes and can be done several times per week (even daily, depending on how deep you go).

And the truth?  
I’ve been resisting this for over 20 years. Mobility work always seemed boring to me — not “sexy,” not exciting. Strength training? Great. Running? Fine. But mobility? I thought it would drain my willpower just to start.

But I was wrong.

Something strange happened. As soon as I started doing it, my body instantly *loved it*. I can’t even explain it rationally. The movements feel natural. It’s almost relaxing. And for once, it doesn’t feel like I’m fighting myself to show up.

Now we’ll see what consistent training brings.
